# Virtual Pet Care: Tamagotchi-Style Game

## Introduction

Virtual Pet Care is a Tamagotchi-style game developed in Java, utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This interactive game simulates a virtual pet, allowing players to care for it by managing its various needs such as food, hygiene, entertainment, and rest. The game dynamically responds to the player's actions, influencing the pet's health and happiness.

## Features

Dynamic Pet States: The pet's needs (hunger, hygiene, social, and sleep) change over time and respond to player interactions.
Strategy Pattern Implementation: Adaptable pet behavior based on mood and user actions.
Simple GUI: User-friendly interface developed with Java Swing, displaying the pet's current states and action controls.
MVC Architecture: Ensures a clear separation of concerns - model handles game logic, view manages display, and controller facilitates communication.
